  <p>This is for Component 3, demonstrating the power of the dynamic :is attribute in Vue.js.
    With the :is attribute, we can dynamically render different components or HTML elements based on varying
    conditions. This capability greatly improves the flexibility and maintainability of our applications.
    y using :is, Component 3 can be displayed according to specific application states or user actions, making
    the user interface more dynamic and responsive. This approach is beneficial in scenarios where the UI needs
    to change frequently based on data or user input, enabling developers to create more interactive and user-friendly applications.
