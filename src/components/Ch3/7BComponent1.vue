  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Component 1</h2>
  <p>This is for Component 1, showcasing the dynamic :is attribute in Vue.js. The :is attribute
    allows for seamless switching between different components or HTML elements based on dynamic conditions.
    This capability significantly enhances the flexibility, maintainability, and reusability of Vue applications.
    By using the :is attribute, developers can create more interactive and dynamic user interfaces. This example demonstrates how
    :is can be used to dynamically render Component 1. Such dynamic rendering techniques are particularly useful in scenarios where t
    he UI needs to adapt to different states or data-driven conditions, making applications more responsive and user-friendly.
