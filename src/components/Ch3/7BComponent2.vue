  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Component 2</h2>
  <p>This is for Component 2, illustrating the use of the dynamic :is attribute in Vue.js.
    The :is attribute provides the flexibility to switch between various components or HTML elements
    dynamically. This feature enhances the reusability and maintainability of code by allowing developers
    to create more modular and adaptable user interfaces. By leveraging the :is attribute, Component 2
    can be rendered based on specific conditions or states, making the application more interactive and responsive.
    This technique is especially useful in complex applications where the UI needs to adapt to changing data or user interactions seamlessly.
